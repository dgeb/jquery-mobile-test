# jquery-mobile-test

A simple test of page loading and removal. For details, see:
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2520

Please see the branches of this project to see the different behaviour.

## jquery-mobile 1.0b1

In this branch, pages are cached, but are removed from the cache as soon as another one is shown. This strategy works well.
